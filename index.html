      <div  class="about-me">
        <p>I have had the pleasure of living in Portland, Oregon for the better part of a decade. It's a beautiful place to be and I'm thankful to have met some great folks and had some meaningful experiences here. I moved from Miami, Florida in 2007 as a bass player in a band and I've been privaleged to play with many other great groups and talented musicians over the last ten years. The project I'm most proud of is Ancient Heat, a 9-piece disco band I started in 2009.</p>

        <p>After Ancient Heat dissolved in 2016, I decided to start a new career in computer programmimg. There are a lot of options when it comes to code schools but I eventually decided to enroll at Epicodus. They seemed to offer the most unique and potentially rewarding program. This webpage that you're looking at is the culmination of my first week's work.</p>

        <p>At the start of 2017 I find myself in school for the first time in almost 15 years, engaged to my soul mate and the proud father of two frustrating puppies. My life is hectic but rewarding and my future is uncertain but promising. Please keep checking back! As I grow as a programmer I will update this site to reflect the concepts I've learned.
